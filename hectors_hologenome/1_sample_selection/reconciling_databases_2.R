#### 8. Jettisoning the apparent duplicates before matching up to Pathology_data




# Leaving reconciliation_notes for the end because these are contextual



# Population broad_location based on sample code where this is known e.g. BP = Banks Peninsula, KK = Kaikoura, TI = Timaru

# Ditch duplicates before combining with Pathology data


# EXCLUDE "Cephalorhynchus hectori ?"

# PRIORITIZE BECTORS (GIVES US AN IDEA OF ENVIRONMENTAL VS INHERITED) (AND HECTORS IN RANGE OF MAUI E.G. CHE12NZ02 - these are bectors -- There were two samples that have been classified as Hector's, but sampled in the range of the MƒÅui (CHE11NZ06 and CHE12NZ02)
# PRIORITIZE SAMPLED BY BIOPSY AND STRANDING (COMPARATIVE)
# PRIORITIZE KNOWN DEATHS
# INCLUDE BIOPSIES OF SIMILAR AGES TO STRANDED SAMPLES FOR LIVE VS DEATH COMPARISON
# BALANCED SAMPLING NORTH ISLAND, NORTH COAST SOUTH ISLAND, WEST COAST SOUTH ISLAND, EAST COAST SOUTH ISLAND, SOUTH COAST SOUTH ISLAND
# MTDNA/MICROSATELLITES AVAILABLE (MAKES IT MORE LIKELY IT IS A VIABLE SAMPLE/DOUBLE CHECK FOR SAMPLE MIX UPS)
# MHC available
# LARGE NUMBER OF MICROSATELLITES LOCI BETTER THAN LESS?
# AGE CLASS?

# Potentially don't want the Checked=="No" sample. Don't want Common_name=="Uncertain"
# Date_received=="Nov-05" might be interesting - all caught in same net

# Double check no problems in the reconciliation_notes after high-grading for samples.

# "CHE05NZ18" has more info in it from Massey, so suggest taking it as the "sample of reference", but also referring to 'Che05NZ08' for additional/duplicate tissue if needed. 
# Question: how independent are these likely to be if given a different code?

# "CHE10NZ04" has more info in it from Massey, so suggest taking it as the "sample of reference", but also referring to 'CHE10NZ10' for additional/duplicate tissue if needed. Will also update the NAs for

# bectors 1 =  NI10-03, Bectors2 = Chem15NZ08 and Chem16NZ31, Bectors 3 = NI10-24, NI11-11 and Chem15NZ04

# Neils Beach Jackson Bay, South Westland could be interesting samples ( four co-caught dolphins)

# Would the parent/fetus pairs be of any interest?

# Museum samples to look at genomic loss of diversity?

#DOC_Massey_database ($DOC_incident_no) should be able to be massaged to match up to Pathology_data ($H_no.)

#Maui_recapture should be able to be matched up to DOC_Massey_database ($UoA_Code) and NZCETA_archive ($Code) based on $Indiv_ID
