### QIIME2
The second approach involved using Qiime2, following instructions at: https://otagoedna.github.io/getting_started_with_qiime2/

On NeSI there is a QIIME2 module (on boros you would need to `module load conda` and then `source activate qiime2-2019.7`)
```
module load QIIME2/2019.7 
```
When in interactive session you can run the following in order to allow tab complete of qiime commands:
```
source tab-qiime
```
